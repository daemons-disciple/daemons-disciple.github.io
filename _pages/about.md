> _Fall in love with some activity, and do it! Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn't matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough. Work as hard and as much as you want to on the things you like to do the best. **~Richard Feynman**_

Hi! I am <strong style="letter-spacing: 1px">Shubhendra Rajkarne</strong>, a human who is in the senior year of **B.E. Computer Science and Engineering**.

When I first started programming, I was fascinated with the endless possibilities that it had bestowed on Humankind. I made this blog to share and learn more about applications of programming in various disciplines and to understand how things connect in this binary world.

Not really a front-end guy.

When I am not programming, you may find me reading manga, watching anime or just conserving energy by hibernating.
