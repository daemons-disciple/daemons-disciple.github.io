> _Fall in love with some activity, and do it! Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn't matter. Explore the world.

Hi! I am <strong style="letter-spacing: 1px">Shubhendra Rajkarne</strong>, a senior at CS major.

I am trying to discover more applications of programming in daily life or other disciplines
This blog is my attempt to learn more about various discplines that involves that programming in general.

Not really a front-end guy.

When I am not programming, you may find me reading manga, watching anime or just hibernating.
